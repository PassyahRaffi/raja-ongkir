# PROJECT RAJA ONGKIR

This project utilizes the **Raja Ongkir API** to implement GET and POST requests within a web application. Raja Ongkir provides a comprehensive API that allows developers to access information about various shipping logistics and costs across Indonesia.

## Overview
The project aims to provide an easy-to-use interface where users can quickly check shipping rates between two locations. It leverages the **Starter** version of the Raja Ongkir API, which includes essential features suited for small to medium-sized applications.

## Features
- **GET Requests**: Retrieve and display the list of provinces and cities available in Indonesia.
- **POST Requests**: Calculate the shipping cost between two cities using different courier services.
